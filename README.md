Building reproducible AI applications and shipping MVPs for startups worldwide. From Ruby on Rails to AI frameworks, I help founders turn ideas into production systems that scale.

- Operating globally from the Philippines with startup-first processes
- MVP to MLP evolution: from functional to lovable products

**CMP Architecture**: Evangelizing Context-Memory-Prompt patterns for reproducible AI applications
- Version-locked components for auditability and drift detection
- Generator-driven development with Rails-like scaffolding

**Contexis Framework**: Leading development of CLI-first AI framework with sensible defaults
- Multi-language core (Go orchestration, Python plugins, Rust kernels)
- Confidence-gating between local OSS and API models

## Core stack and expertise

**Frontend**: React, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin
**AI/ML**: Go orchestration, Python integrations, Rust performance kernels
**Infrastructure**: Cost-optimized AWS (EC2, S3+CDN, RDS), scaling strategies

## Technical philosophy
